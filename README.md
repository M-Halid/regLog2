Arbeitsteilung:


**Team Member 1: Backend Development**
1. Set up the project structure: Create the directory structure for the project and initialize a new Node.js project using npm.
2. Design the data structure: Define the structure of the user data, including username, password, and additional profile information, using JavaScript objects and arrays.
3. Implement user registration functionality:
   - Create server-side routes to handle user registration requests.
   - Validate the input for requirements like username uniqueness, password complexity, etc.
   - Store the user details securely in a JSON file or a database (if you prefer to use one).
4. Implement user login functionality:
   - Create server-side routes to handle user login requests.
   - Verify the entered credentials against the stored user data.
   - Generate a session token or identifier and send it as a response upon successful login.
5. Implement user profile management functionality:
   - Create server-side routes to handle profile retrieval and update requests.
   - Retrieve and update the user's profile information in the JSON file or the database.
6. Handle error cases:
   - Implement proper error handling for scenarios like invalid inputs, duplicate usernames during registration, incorrect login credentials, etc.
7. Test the backend functionality:
   - Write unit tests to verify the registration, login, and profile management functionalities.
   - Test different scenarios and edge cases to ensure the proper functioning of the backend code.

**Team Member 2: Frontend Development**
1. Set up the project structure: Create the directory structure for the frontend and set up the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2. Integrate HTML templates: Insert the HTML templates for registration, login, and profile management forms into the respective HTML files.
3. Implement form validation:
   - Write JavaScript functions to handle form submissions and perform client-side validation.
   - Validate user input for requirements like username uniqueness, password complexity, etc.
4. Implement user registration:
   - Write JavaScript functions to handle form submissions and gather form data.
   - Send the form data to the backend server using the HTML form's `action` attribute, directing it to the appropriate server-side route.
5. Implement user login:
   - Write JavaScript functions to handle form submissions and gather form data.
   - Send the form data to the backend server using the HTML form's `action` attribute, directing it to the appropriate server-side route.
6. Implement user profile management:
   - Write JavaScript functions to handle form submissions and gather form data.
   - Send the form data to the backend server using the HTML form's `action` attribute, directing it to the appropriate server-side route.
7. Test the frontend functionality:
   - Test the registration, login, and profile management forms to ensure they function correctly.
   - Verify that form submissions are sent to the backend server correctly and receive the expected responses.

**Team Member 3: Integration and Testing**
1. Integrate the frontend and backend:
   - Link the frontend HTML files to the appropriate JavaScript files for form submissions, validation, and gathering form data.
   - Ensure that the frontend interacts correctly with the backend by using the server-side routes for user registration, login, and profile management.
2. Test the overall system:
   - Write integration tests to ensure the seamless flow of registration, login, and profile management between the frontend and backend.
   - Test different user scenarios and edge cases to validate the entire system.
3. Error handling and edge case testing:
   -

 Identify potential error scenarios and edge cases in the application flow and write test cases to handle them.
   - Test for scenarios like invalid user inputs, server errors, etc.
